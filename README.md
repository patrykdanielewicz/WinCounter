# WinCounter
A badminton application for counting points and displaying matches and statistics. It allows users to add players or teams, which can then compete against each other in sparring matches. Match results are saved in SwiftData on iCloud.

Each player can view their statistics â€“ both general (number of matches played, won, and lost) and detailed, including performance in specific sparring matches and comparisons with other players.

The app features a convenient Apple Watch version, allowing users to quickly track match scores from their wrist. These data synchronize with iCloud, making them accessible in the iOS app.
